The Seattle Internet Exchange is moving our port from their Arista loaner switch to the new Arista 7512R. An outage of approximately 20 minutes is expected during one of the above maintenance windows.

All addresses on Wobscale-announced prefixes will not be accessible from the general internet during the outage. It may take a few minutes after the port is restored for prefix announcements to propagate globally. The backup management network will not be affected.
