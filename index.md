## Incidents

### Upstream carrier outage (2017-05-18)

Our upstream carrier, Hurricane Electric, appears to be having an outage in Seattle.

The outage has affected the SIX route server prefix counts so we are assuming their NOC is engaged.

We will provide information here when available, likely after the incident is resolved, and will be reviewing options for a backup carrier provider.

## Upcoming maintenance windows

There are no upcoming maintenance windows.

## Completed maintenance

### Seattle Internet Exchange port move (2017-01-10)

Our port to the Seattle Internet Exchange was moved from their Arista loaner switch to the new Arista 7512R.

All addresses on Wobscale-announced prefixes were not accessible from the general internet for approximately 20 minutes.
